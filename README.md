<h1>YASB - Yet Another Shoe Bot</h1>

YASB is a Google Chrome Extension that automatically adds shoes to the shopping cart as soon as the item has loaded on the product page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong><br>
        <ul>
            <li>footlocker.com</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Personal or Consumer Use Functionality</strong><br>
Two versions of YASB can currently be compiled; A personal use version, and a consumer version that can sold. By default it is set for personal use. The interface can be set so that YASB can be sold, requiring an activation key to work. Changing the value of the variable 'client' to "consumer", enables YASB to require an activation key. Changing that same value to "personal" sets YASB to work straight out of the box. The current user activation key is "yasb", but can be changed to anything desired.
    </li>
</ul>

--------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the source code distribution of YASB. A compiled 'ready to use' version (.CRX) will be available for both personal and consumer use as soon as an official project page is up.
